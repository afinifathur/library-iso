## Deploy checklist (summary)
- Merge these files into Laravel project.
- Ensure `App\Console\Kernel.php` registers the import command (kernel.php -> $commands[])
- Add route include in `routes/web.php`: `require base_path('routes/iso_documents.php');`
- Ensure auth scaffold is present (Breeze / Jetstream) or remove auth middleware on routes for testing.
- Set disk 'documents' in config/filesystems.php as shown.
- Run `php artisan migrate` then `php artisan documents:import imports`.
- Open /documents (login required).
